# Prerequisites
To run the code, the following packages must be installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib and seaborn
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- xgboost



# K-fold cross-validation

K-fold cross-validation for classification involves splitting a dataset into \(K\) "folds," training a model on \(K-1\) folds, and testing on the remaining fold. This process is repeated \(K\) times, and the results are averaged to provide a robust estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. 


# LazyPredict :

is a powerful Python library designed to streamline and partially automate machine learning workflows. It rapidly generates a wide range of baseline models with minimal coding effort, enabling users to efficiently compare algorithm performance prior to any hyperparameter tuning



# Fitting and Evaluating the Models

The table generated by LazyPredict provides a quick comparison of multiple classification models based on key performance metrics such as Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, ROC AUC, F1 Score, and computation time. These metrics help evaluate how well each model handles both balanced and imbalanced data, measures class‑separation ability, and balances precision with recall. Among all tested models, Based on the results of Lazy Predict, we choose the top 3 models,

# Confusion matrix and classification report

Based on the results, we can see that the three Models are the best for predicting 



# Conclusions :

- Segment customer job roles into corporate tiers and prioritize outreach to tier‑1 professionals early in the campaign cycle.

- Based on the exploratory data analysis and model selection, it is evident that call duration plays a significant role in determining the outcome of the dataset. Leads who show greater interest in initiating a deposit tend to have more frequent interactions, with call lengths exceeding the average. Additionally, factors such as job role and educational background emerge as key influencers, strongly shaping the likelihood of a positive result.

- Reaching out to leads at the beginning of the new banking cycle (May–July) is advisable, as historical data indicates stronger positive outcomes during this period.

- Engage with leads more attentively to gather detailed insights, allowing the bank to tailor deposit plans effectively. This approach can extend call duration and significantly improve the chances of securing a deposit.
